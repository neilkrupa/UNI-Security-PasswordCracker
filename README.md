# UNI-Security-PasswordCracker
This is a university project which uses dictionaries and combinations to use a brute force attack on a list of encrypted passwords to attempt to recover as many as possible.

You are able to download the repository and run cracker.exe to brute force the hashed passwords in the "password.txt"

DO NOT USE THIS FOR ACTUALLY CRACKING HACKED PASSWORDS, IT IS FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY.
